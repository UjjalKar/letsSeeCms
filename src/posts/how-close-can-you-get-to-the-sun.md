The sun’s surface the coldest part still burns at an insane 5,550 degrees Fahrenheit. Very few things besides other suns could survive that kind of heat. 

## Does a space suit enough to survive?

A standard space suit will protect an astronaut by temperatures of up to 248 degrees Fahrenheit; still great in most instances, but extremely poor for trying to touch the sun.

## How close could you make with a space suit?

The sun is about 93 million miles away from Earth, and it’s at about 3 million miles from the surface that temperatures would scorch up to above 248 degrees Fahrenheit. Relatively speaking, this is still pretty close.

## What are the things will kill you beside enormous heat?

There are a couple of other things to consider  namely that cosmic radiation would probably kill you before you reach a complete half the distance to the sun. Modern shielding against space radiation is still quite poor, and before trying to make sure astronauts won’t melt on their way to the sun, we need to make sure their bodies aren’t irradiated hellholes.

## Future solution?

Besides that, one solution that may help future astronauts make it closer to the sun would be mirrored shielding. The 2007 film Sunshine depicted a spacecraft fitted with an incredibly huge optical shield designed to bounce the sun’s rays away — which could help ensure the spacecraft stays cool enough.

## Conclusion

Of course, the sun doesn't merely heat the Earth; it also keeps the planet in orbit. If its mass suddenly disappeared (this is equally impossible, by the way), the planet would fly off, like a ball swung on a string and suddenly let go.
